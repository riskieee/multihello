# sayhello ðŸ‘‹

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/riskieee/sayhello/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/riskieee/sayhello?branch=main)

An npm library to return a greeting as a string like `Moni (Chewa)` from initially 100 languages.

## Why?

As our colorful world have way more than 100 languages this project tries to get you excited about it. So you may use it to greet your visitors and users on your landing page or just to surprise yourself with the diversity of the languages on our planet Earth. I had the idea in a text capture web project to greet the visitors and at the same time allow them to use their language.

Funfact: 'Moni' is used in the Chewa language as spoken in Southern, Southeast and East Africa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewa_language

# NPM Installation

As you like install sayhello as dev or dependence librarty:

```sh
# local
$ npm i sayhello
```

```sh
# global
$ npm -g i sayhello
```

```sh
# local dev
$ npm -D i sayhello
```

# Usage by Example with Options

Run the examples with

```js
node run demo
```

To use it as a npm library in your project, you just need to import it in a JS file:

```js
const sayhello = require('./sayhello.js')
```

As sayhello returns you a string just by call you may use it like:

1. Random output without options

```js
console.log(sayhello())
// random output: Hallo (German)
```

2. Use an integer for a specific language as ordered in hellos.json

```js
console.log(sayhello(0))
// fixed output: Hello (English)
```

3. You may use a complete or partial string to search for a specific language or hello. If nothing is found you get 'Sorry, no match :('

```js
console.log(sayhello('dish'))
// found output: Hej (Swedish)
```
